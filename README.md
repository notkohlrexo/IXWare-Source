# IXWare-Source
official & latest source of ixware.xyz, ixware.com, ixware.net, ixware.dev, ixware.biz, ixware.org, ixware.cc, ixware.co and so on.


# Notice
I do not recommend using the source in the real world, it was my first project based on "pure" PHP & bootstrap etc. 
The code is really a mess, I only recommend using it for educational purposes.

The website overall is poorly coded in my opinion, it is also slow if 90+ people use it at the same time, the issue for that is because of the poorly implemented 
mysql queries and the old realtime/chat server. The realtime & chat server is removed from the source.

I also moved on, I'm not using PHP as backend anymore and I also don't code in c# anymore.

Things which won't work:
- Chat
- Realtime interaction
- Javascript Logging (Roblox)

To get the website to work you need the right sql file, which I'm not providing as of now, add the tables etc. yourself if you really want to test the site.


# What was IXWare?
